# Immigration Data Visualization

## Overview
This project is a part of my data visualization class and focuses on analyzing and visualizing immigration trends using Python. The dataset used in this project contains immigration records from various countries to Canada between 1980 and 2024. The primary goal is to explore and understand immigration patterns from different regions, including conflict-driven countries and Vietnam, as well as the distribution of immigrants across continents.

## Dataset
The dataset (`data_canada.csv`) consists of:
- `Country`: The name of the country.
- `Continent`: The continent the country belongs to.
- `ISO Code`: The ISO country code.
- `1980-2024`: The number of immigrants arriving in Canada each year.

## Visualizations
The project includes the following visualizations:

### 1. Immigration Trends from Conflict-Driven Countries (1980-2024)
- Countries analyzed: Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan.
- A **line plot** is used to visualize the annual immigration trends for these countries.
- The plot provides insights into how immigration has fluctuated over the years.

### 2. Proportion of Immigrants by Continent (1980-2024)
- A **pie chart** is used to represent the total number of immigrants from each continent.
- The chart provides a clear view of the distribution of immigration across different regions.

### 3. Immigration Distribution from Vietnam (1980-2024)
- A **box plot** is used to display the distribution of annual immigration numbers from Vietnam.
- This helps identify trends, variations, and any outliers in the immigration data.

## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries are used for data handling and visualization:
- `pandas` for data manipulation.
- `seaborn` for advanced visualizations.
- `matplotlib` for generating plots.

## Code Execution
Upload the dataset to your Google Colab environment and run the script cell by cell.

## Learning Outcome
This project helps in understanding how to:
- Process and transform data for visualization.
- Use **line plots, pie charts, and box plots** to gain insights into trends.
- Customize plots using Seaborn and Matplotlib for better readability.
